# Schmidt Ocean Public technical Documnetation  â€” Site Moved

This documentation site has moved!  
All content and future updates are now hosted on our Notion workspace:

ðŸ‘‰ **[https://schmidtocean.notion.site/techdocs](https://schmidtocean.notion.site/techdocs)**

---

### Why the move?

Weâ€™ve transitioned to Notion to make it easier for our teams and collaborators to:
- Keep technical documentation up to date  
- Collaborate directly within project pages  
- Search, comment, and cross-link resources seamlessly

---

### Whatâ€™s here?

This repository now only contains:
- A simple redirect page (`index.html`)  
- A `404.html` fallback redirect  
- This `README.md` for context  

These ensure anyone visiting the old GitHub Pages site is automatically redirected to the new home on Notion.
